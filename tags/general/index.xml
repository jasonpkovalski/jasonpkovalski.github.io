      <description>After years of talking about starting a blog, here it finally is. This is a personal blog, and I want to use it to share my knowledge and excitement with as many people as possible.
I spend a lot of time and effort on my interests, so I&#39;m happy to have this platform to talk about them. Initially, I would like to focus my content on technology and finance, but posts about fitness and eSports are fair game too.</description>
