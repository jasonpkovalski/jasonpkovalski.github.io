 I love technology, from shiny gadgets that I definitely don&#39;t need to what I do at work everyday. My expertise is primarily in automation, infrastructure, and cloud computing. Some of the things I regularly use include: Python, Go, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, and AWS. More details on my professional experience can be found here.</description>
