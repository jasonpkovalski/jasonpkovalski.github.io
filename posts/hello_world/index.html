<p>I spend a lot of time and effort on my interests, so I'm happy to have this platform to talk about them. Initially, I would like to focus my content on <strong>technology</strong> and <strong>finance</strong>, but posts about <strong>fitness</strong> and <strong>eSports</strong> are fair game too. Some topics you can expect are gadget reviews, software engineering tutorials, and investment tips.</p>
<h3 id="goals-for-blog">Goals for Blog</h3>
<ul>
<li>Create valuable content</li>
<li>Document my journey</li>
<li>Earn passive income</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep in mind that I haven't written anything besides code since college, so please bear with my mediocre writing for the time being. I promise it will improve!</p>
